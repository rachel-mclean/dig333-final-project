Secret knock detecting computer lock

#### Milestones: [1](#Milestone-1) [2](#Milestone-2) [3](#Milestone-3) [4](#Milestone-4)

## Final Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: 
Decide how the motor and lock are rigged, gather materials, and construct the physical device.

  1. I scavenged some hinges from an old wooden box to use on my physical case. I also scavenged an old raspberry pi case from the Maker Space to use as casing for some of my electric components.

### Milestone 2: 
Write the necessary Python Code: 1) for the sensor to recognize a knock and 2) for the motor to turn when the sensor correctly recognizes a knock.

### Milestone 3:
Test all components with the RaspberryPi on a breadboard to test functionality of the code.

### Milestone 4:
Attach a BlueTooth module that sends an alert when the wrong knock is performed.
