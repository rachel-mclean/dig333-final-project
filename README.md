Secret knock detecting computer lock

#### Milestones: [1](#Milestone-1) [2](#Milestone-2) [3](#Milestone-3) [4](#Milestone-4)

## Final Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: 
Decide how the motor and lock are rigged, gather materials, and construct the physical device.

* I scavenged some hinges from an old wooden box to use on my computer case. I also scavenged an old raspberry pi case from the Maker Space to use as casing for some of my electric components.

* Using Tinkercad, I created an updated design iteration of my project (updated Tinkercad design [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/37gWwb9qrOn-exquisite-blorr/edit))

* In the Makerspace, I created files for the different components of the computer case on Adobe. Then, I used the laser cutter  to cut out the different parts of my case. I used sandpaper to sand down the edges. Luca, an employee in the Maker Space, guided me on how to use Adobe and the laser cutter.
* Luca and I also used the laser cutter to engrave a door-knock shape onto the 4 sides of the case. I thought this was a fun touch to subtly suggest the purpose of the case.

* I glued two of the sides using wood glue before realizing that I should attach the hinged part of the case first. I first began to attach the hinge on the outside using a drill, before realizing that the screws ruined the door-knock design on my wooden piece. I then attached the hinge on the inside of the wooden pieces, before realizing that this prevented the hinged side from opening. Finally, I re-attached the hinge to the outside of the case. Unfortunately, this interrupted the engraved design, but worked.
* I then glued all pieces together and waited for them to dry.

### Milestone 2: 
Write the necessary Python Code: 1) for the sensor to recognize a knock and 2) for the motor to turn when the sensor correctly recognizes a knock.

### Milestone 3:
Test all components with the RaspberryPi on a breadboard to test functionality of the code.

### Milestone 4:
Finalize casing for the sensor, motor, and raspberry pi on the physical device. If time permits, attach a BlueTooth module that sends an alert when the wrong knock is performed.
